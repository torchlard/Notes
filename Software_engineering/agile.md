# intro
iterative approach to deliver project throughout lifecycle

- break reuirement into smaller pieces
- promotes collaborative working
- reflects, learn, adjust at regular intervals => ensure customer always satisfied
- integrate planning with execution

# VS waterfall
## customer collaboration VS contract negotiation

## individual interaction OVER process and tools
require behaviour change

## respond to change OVER following structured plan
waterfall used agreed scope to create time, resource plan

establish resources and time which ultimately drive scope
establish minimum viable product
  - core project deliverable to trigger start of delivery

## prototyping / working solution OVER comprehensive documentation



# methodology
## agile
group of software development methodologies based on iteractive development
promote disciplined project management encourages frequent inspection and adaptation

## scrum
subset of agile
lighweight process framework for agile development

process framework: practice must be followed for process to be consistent with framework
lightweight: overhead minimal

### process
Sprint 1: plan > build > test > review
Sprint 2: plan > build > test > review
Sprint 3: plan > build > test > review
...

product backlog > sprint planning > sprint backlog > sprint > potentially shippable product
> sprint review / retrospective



### roles
Product Owner: define functionality, ideas of product
Scrum Master: protect process
TEam: developer, tester, writer


### artifacts
product backlog: gather requirements that could go into product
sprint backlog: top priority product planning
User stories: As a xxx, I need xxx, So that xxx

### ceremonies
Sprint Planning
Daily Scrum
Sprint Review: at end of sprint, what do improve process, bring forward


# kanban
agile coach = scrum master

scrum board


# Kanban VS scrum
## role
scrum master, product owner, team
    VS
no set roles defined, roles not required to be cross functional

## work boards
columns labeled to reflect periods 
    VS
columns likewise labeled to show workflow states 
also publish max number of stories allowed in column at once

## scheduling
heavy emphasis on schedule with prioritized list of story points
    VS
no required time boxes / iterations
continual improvement expeced to occur in evolutionary fashion


## diff
scrum limit amount of time allowed to complete particular amount of work
    VS
Kanban limits amount of work allowed in any one condition
