# SOLID
in OOP, SOLID is combination of 5 design principle -> more flexible, understandable, maintainable
## Single responsibility principle
class only have 1 responsibility == 1 reason that cause change
## Open/closed principle
software entity open for extension, closed for modification
## Liskov substitution principle
object are replaceable with instances of subtypes without altering correctness of that program
## Interface segregation principle
client-specific interface better than 1 general-purpose interface
## Dependency inversion principle
depend upon abstractions, not concretions


# Inversion of control (IoC)
## dependency injection
Inversion of Control = methodology
Dependency injetion = implementation of IoC

convention:
1. caller create object instances
2. caller run instance methods by object

DI:
1. other component create object instances
2. caller run those instances directly

target: loose coupling

## service locator
another implementation of IoC
