# TDD
TDD not same as unit test

write failing test before writing code

# testing levels
Unit: fully isolated, testing 1 function
  - write thousands of these

Integration: with dependencies (test function that call a function)
  - good couple of these

System: End-to-End Test, full flow
  - write a few

# nodejs
Jest

xxx.test.js , xxx.spec.js
