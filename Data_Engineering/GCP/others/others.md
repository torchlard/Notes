Your company is moving your data analytics to BigQuery. Your other operations will remain on-premises. You need to transfer 800 TB of historic data. You also need to plan for 30 Gbps of daily data transfers that must be appended for analysis the next day. You want to follow Google-recommended practices to transfer your data. What should you do?

D. Use a Transfer Appliance to move the existing data to Google Cloud. Set up a Dedicated or Partner Interconnect for daily transfers.


 
You used a small amount of data to build a machine learning model that gives you good inferences during testing. However, the results show more errors when real-world data is used to run the model. No additional data can be collected for testing. You want to get a more accurate view of the model's capability. What should you do?

C. Create feature crosses that will add new columns to increase the data.
 this model appears to be overfitting. Using cross-validation will run the validation on multiple folds of the data, which reduces the overfitting.
