-If you got the job at Twitter and got access to all of its data 
what kind of data analysis would you like to perform? 

Given a list of all followers in format: 123, 345 234, 678 345, 123 ... 
where the first column contains the id of the follower, and the second one is the id of who's followed, find all mutual follows(pair 123, 345 in the example above). Do the same in the case, when this list does not fit into the memory (they were expecting a solution, that would use MapReduce).
