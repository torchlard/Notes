# background
## explain data engineering
application of data collection and research

## what is data modelling
method of documenting complex software design as diagram

## list various types of design schema in data modelling
1. star schema
2. snowflake schema

## four V's of big data
velocity
variety
volume
veracity


# structured vs unstructured data
| parameter        | structured | unstructured                                     |
|------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| storage          | DBMS       | file structures                                  |
| standard         | SQL        | csv,xml                                          |
| integration tool | ETL        | manual data entry/batch processing includes code |
| scaling          | difficult  | very easy                                        |

# hadoop
## component
HDFS: file system which hadoop data stored
MapReduce: algorithm for large scale data processing
YARN: reousrce management within Hadoop cluster

## what is NameNode
store data of HDFS, tracks various files across cluster

## define Hadoop streaming
utility allow creation of map and reduce jobs 
submit them to specific cluster

## block, block scanner

## hadoop features



# warehouse design
## explain star schema
structure like a star
center has 1 fact table and multiple associated dimension table

## explain snowflake schema
extension of star schema

## star VS snowflake schema



# how to deploy big data solution
1. integrate data using RDBMS, MySQL, ...
2. store data in either NoSQL / 

# database
## list out objects created by create statement in mysql
database
index
table
user
procedure
trigger
event
view
function
