# intro
end-to-end test are good, but slow, expensive and difficult to construct

unit test highly desirable
Extract and load modules isn't suitable for unit testing

all testable logic should be in Transform component

can pass predefined datasets and test transformed output against expected results


# unittest python
assertEqual
assertNotEqual

assertTrue, assertFalse
assertGreater, assertLess

assertListEqual, assertTupleEqual
assertDictEqual

assertCountEqual: list equal regardless of order
