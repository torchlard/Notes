# Blockchain
## abstract view
replicaed state machine
validator: replicator in system

users send transaction to validators
concensus protocol to maintain replicated state IF
- validator start from same initial state
- agree on what next transaction be
- execute deterministic state transition

as long as consensus protocol ensures total order among transaction 
and state transition scheme is deterministic => harmony

## open system
libra blockchain is open system
anyone can view current blockchain state / submit transactions to validator

scarcity: supply of assets in system should be controlled
access control: protect assets with access control policies
