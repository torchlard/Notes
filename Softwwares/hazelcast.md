# intro
open source in-memory data grid based on Java
data evenly distributed among nodes of computer cluster => horizontal scaling

backups distributed among nodes
integrate with cloud intrastructure, deployment technologies

manage memory for many different types of applications

## usage
- application scaling
- cache-as-a-service
- cross JVM communication and shared storage
- distributed cache
- in-memory processing
