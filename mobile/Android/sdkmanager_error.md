Set your preferred ANDROID_HOME (just like before)
Download and unpack the commandlinetools zip file into a directory called cmdline-tools, which is inside ANDROID_HOME
Append the directory $ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/tools/bin to environment variable PATH, so that the system knows where to find sdkmanager

# Warning: Failed to find package install
