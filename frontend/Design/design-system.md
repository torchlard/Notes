# history
## early time 
- emphasize component oriented design, consistent theme, styling code and design guidline
problem: new component may have conflict with original styles

## Brad Frost's atomic design
based on web design, a systematic way of thinking
complete business request and build component library based on design system

atom: font, button, icon, color platte
molecule: search bar, button combination, paragraph, table
organism: navigation, registration, submission, selet label
template: UE/UX
page: appearance, UI (have template variable)

## example
Material design, windos guidline (Fluent Design), SAP Fiori, 
Bootstrap / Foundation / Semantic UI 
Ant Design, Apple Design

# process
## demonstrate, not speak; interface inventories
interface inventory (collection of fragments in UI)
  ~ 
content inventory

## what style involve
global element, navigation, logo, icon, button, title, blocks, list, 
interactive components(tab, carousel), media, 3rd pary element, advertisement,
message, color, animation

## demonstrate result
## next step: manage remaining items

# styles
## style tiles
do not create high fidelity image, may not match with expectation of developer
create style tiles to fix styles for different components
think based on mode

## element collages

## maintain pattern library
if pattern library no longer reflect the current state of product, it becomes outdated
