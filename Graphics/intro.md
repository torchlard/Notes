# area
1. modeling: mathematical spec of shape and appearance properties
2. rendering: creation of shaded image from 3D computer model
3. animation: create illusion of motion through sequences of images

## graphics pipeline
geometric manipulation can accomplish in 4D space
4th homogeneous coord help perspective viewing

spped image generation ~ number of triangles drawn


# class 
vector2
vector3
hvector: homogeneous vector
rgb: store 3 components
transform: 4x4 matrix 
image: 2D array of RGB pixels

## float vs double
efficient: single-precision data
avoid numerical problem: double-precision

double: geometric computation
float: color computation

much of graphics is just translating math directly into code
=> cleaner math, cleaner resulting code
