# type
## mono
left and right speaker output same sound
- file size half of stereo counterparts

## stereo
2 channels
- provides sound direction and location
- possibility of multi-track recording

## 5.1 surrounding sound
5 standard speakers, 1 subwoofer
invented by Douby labs

front-left(-30 deg), center(direct front), front-right (30 deg)
surround-L (-110 deg), surround-R (110 deg)

## 7.1 surrounding sound
7 standard speakers, 1 subwoofer
5.1 + 2 speakers at back

## 5.1.1
5: traditional speakers
1: subwoofers
2: ceiling / upward-firing speakers

# woofer (bass speaker)
loudspeaker designed to produce low freq sounds (40Hz - 500Hz)


# subwoofer
loudspeaker designed to reproduce low-pitched audio freq (bass, sub-bass)

# human
most human can hear down to about 20Hz

# audio signal
representation of sound
analog: level of electrical voltage
digital: series of binary numbers

audio freq: 20 - 20k Hz (lower, upper limit of human hearing)
audio channel = audio signal communications channel in storage device / mixing console

# transparency
measure of lossy data compression perceptually indistinguishable from uncompressed input
transparency threshold: given value that transparency is reached

# variable bitrate (VBR)
opposed to constant bitrate, vary amount of output data per time
higher bitrate for more complex segments of media files
mp3, WMA, aac can optionally encoded in VBR

## disadv
in past many hardware and software players could not decode variable bitrate files properly
