# 3 choose 2
performance

fault tolerance

# normal RAID level
## raid 0
faster, no fault 

## raid 1
mirror, very high redundancy

## raid 5
allow 1 fail, distribute data across >= 2 disk without parity

## raid 6
same as raid 5 with one more parity block

# nested RAID level
## raid 50
raid 5 + raid 0

## raid 60
raid 6 + raid 0


# Host Bus Adapter(HBA)
circuit board provide physical connectivity between host system and networks and storage devices
- provide IO processing

can connect SATA, fiber channel, SCSI
HBA card handles all communication with devics, imrpoving performance of host computer

# SCSI adapter
connect SCSI devices to host computer
allow host system to boot from connected SCSI devices
