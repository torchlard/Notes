# input function
create fn to supply data for training, evaluating, prediction

# dataset
## training set
fit parameters of classifier to find optimal weights with back propagation

## validation set
tune parameters of classifier. Find optimal number of hidden units / determine stopping point of back propagation algorithm

## test set
Assess performance of fully-trained classifier. After accessing final model on test set, must not tune model further
