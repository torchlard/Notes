traditionally use inductive learning, learn baesd on labelled data, and induce rules to apply on unlabelled data
since most of data are unlabelled, there are 3 ways to use unlabelled data in learning process

## semi-supervised learning
don't know what to predict in process of learning

## transductive learning
transductive learning: unlabelled data as testing data
inductive learning: unlabelled data is not testing data

## active learning
assume learner has certain ability to control environment, can ask something outside learner to query to get label on testing sample


# Information Quality
data = input to information system
information = output from information system
            = decision making level of reality
representation gap between information and data
- what want to know VS what can be directly verified

## accuracy VS believability
accuracy = mapping from information system to reality
intended mapping / interpretation
- could be set of facts cannot be easily verified

directly verifiable information counts as answer to query -> under lots of assumptions (auxiliary theories)
-> theories cannot be directly verified, but have certain degree of credibility

believable to user X:
information has set of properties Px, which makes information worthy of belief to X

garbage in -> garbage out
quality in -> quality out
quality in -> garbage out
