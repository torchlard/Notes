# formal language
words whose letters taken from alphabet, bell-formed according to specific set of rules
defined by formal grammar (eg. context-free grammar, regular grammar)

formal language theory: study internal structural patterns

## word over alphabet
alphabet: Set, can have infinite elements
word oer alphabet: finite sequence of letters

{ words over alphabet Σ } = Σ*
length of word = #letters
empty word: length = 0, e,ε

in logic, alphabet as vocabulary, word as formulas/sentences

## def
(possibly infinite) set of finite-length strings composed from a given alphabet
many languages described by rules, eg. regular language, context-free language

## example
formal language L, alphabet Σ = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,+,=}
- every nonempty string not contains "+"/"=" not start with "0"
- string "0" is in L
- "=" iff |"="|=1 and separates two valid strings
- no other string in L

## constructions
L = Σ*, set of all words over Σ
L = {a}* = {aⁿ}, n ranges over natural numbers, aⁿ = a repeats n times
set of inputs upon certain Turing machine halts

## lang spec formalism
strings 
- generated by some formal grammar
- described by regular expression
- accepted by some automation (eg. Turing machine, finite state automaton)
- decision procedure produce answer YES

question:
can formalism X describe every lang that formalism Y can describe?
how difficult to decide if given word belong to lang described by formalism X?
how difficult to decide if lang from formalism X and Y same lang?

## operation on lang
1. standard set operation (union, intersection, complement)
2. element-wise applicaiton of string operation
  - concatenation L1̇̇.L2 in form vw, v=string from L1, w=string from L2
  - intersection: exist in both lang
  - complement: all strings over Σ not in L1


# regular language
formal lang that can be expreseed by regular expression OR recongnized by finite automaton

Kleene's theorem: equivalence of regular expression and finite automata

# grammars
## context-free grammars
