# Algebra
## Essence
1. ability to form expression
2. ability to evaluate these expressions

recursion can be abstracted away to uncover real primitives behind expression
=> define non-recursive function, then find its fixed point


ExprF (ExprF (ExprF a)) ...
after infinitely many iteration we shoul get to fix point 
  where further iteration makes no difference

# algebraic group
group that is an algebraic variety

eg. Finite groups, general linear group of invertible matrices over C,
Jet gorup, Elliptic curves
