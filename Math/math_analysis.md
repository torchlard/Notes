## real analysis
deal with real numbers and real-valued functions of real variable
- analytic properties of real functions and sequences
- convergence, limits of seq
- calculus, continuity, smoothness

## complex analysis
investigate functions of complex numbers
useful in algebraic geometry, number theory, applied math, physics

## functional analysis
study of vector space endowed with some kind of limit-related structure (eg. inner product, norm, topology)
- spaces of functions
- Fourier transform

## differential equation
derivatives

## measure theory
measure on set = assign number to each suitable subset of taht set, interpret as its size
- generalization concept of length, area, volume
eg. Lebesgue measure on Euclidean space

measure of 'large' subset decompose into finite/countable num of 'smaller' disjoint subsets

define measure only on sub-collection of all subsets (measurable subsets)
- required to form Ïƒ-algebra
- countable unions, countable intersections and complements of measurable subsets are measurable

Non-meaurable sets which Lebsegue measure cannot be defined consistently

## numerical analysis
study of algorithm that use numerical approximation for problems of mathematical analysis
