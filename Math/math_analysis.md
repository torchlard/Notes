# Concept
## Metric space
set where notion of distance(metric) between elements of set is defined
ordered pair (M,d), where M is set, d is metric

d : M x M -> R such that
1. d(x,y) = 0 iff x=y
2. d(x,y) = d(y,x)
3. d(x,z) ≤ d(x,y) + d(y,z)

eg. measure theory, functional analysis

## Sequences and limits
sequence = ordered list
= function domain is coutable totally ordered set (eg. natural number)

## property
convergence: converge if it has a limit
```
lim aₙ = x
n→∞
```

# Branch
## real analysis
deal with real numbers and real-valued functions of real variable
- analytic properties of real functions and sequences
- convergence, limits of seq
- calculus, continuity, smoothness

## complex analysis
investigate functions of complex numbers
useful in algebraic geometry, number theory, applied math, physics

## functional analysis
study of vector space endowed with some kind of limit-related structure (eg. inner product, norm, topology)
- spaces of functions
- Fourier transform

## differential equation
derivatives

## measure theory
measure on set = assign number to each suitable subset of taht set, interpret as its size
- generalization concept of length, area, volume
eg. Lebesgue measure on Euclidean space

measure of 'large' subset decompose into finite/countable num of 'smaller' disjoint subsets

define measure only on sub-collection of all subsets (measurable subsets)
- required to form σ-algebra
- countable unions, countable intersections and complements of measurable subsets are measurable

Non-meaurable sets which Lebsegue measure cannot be defined consistently

## numerical analysis
study of algorithm that use numerical approximation for problems of mathematical analysis
