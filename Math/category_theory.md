# fundamental
category: abstraction of all mathematical objects
morphism: arrow for mapping of objects

# Types
types are restrictions on composition(morphism) 
  eg. one arrow must be source object of next arrow
stronger type system, better match can be described an verified

Types = sets of values, can be finite or infinite

## halting problem
a program cannot determine whether one program is non-terminating / terminating
so we introduce âŠ¥: never terminate

function that may return bottom = partial, opposed to total functions
  => return valid results for every possible argument

## semantics of language
operational semantics: mechanics of program execution
denotational semantics: every programming constuct is given its mathematical interpretation

computational effect can be mapped to monads
