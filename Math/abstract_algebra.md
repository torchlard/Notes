# injective
f: A -> B
f(x) = f(y) if and only if x=y

# surjective
∀ x∈B, ∃z such that f(z) = x

## group of units
every nonzero k has inverse in Z[0] if k is relatively prime to n
- set of all such non-zero elements as U(n) = group of units

## general linear group
group if there exists inverse matrix A^-1 where (A^-1A) = (AA^-1) = I
det A ≠ 0

# history
study geometric space by examing properties that are invariant under transformation of space
Sopus Lie use group theory to study solution of patrial differential equations

# gorup
inverse, identity, associative

## subgroup
let G be a group
a ∈ G, <a> = {a^k: k ∈ Z} is subgroup of G


## cyclic subgroup
`<a> = {na: n ∈ Z}`
for a ∈ G, <a> = cyclic subgroup generated by a

## cyclic group
G = cyclic group
order of a=n  such that a^n = e (repeat itself when index = n)

cyclic group can have >1 generator

eg. both 1,5 generate Z[6]
in Z[6], <2> = {0, 2, 4}, because 2^3 mod 6 = 2

every cyclic group is abelian

# iosmorphism
group (G,∙) and (H,∘) are isomorphic if bijective ϕ: G -> H
and  ϕ(a∙b) = ϕ(a)∘ϕ(b)

##
let ϕ: H -> G be isomorphism of 2 groups
1. ϕ^-1: H->G also isomorphism
2. |G| = |H|
3. if G is abelian, then H is abelian
4. if G is cyclic, then H is cyclic
5. if G subgroup of order n, then H subgroup of order n

##
- all cyclic groups of infinite orders are isomorphic to Z
- if G is cyclic group of order n, then G is isomorphic to Z[n]

## goal
The isomorphism of groups determines an equivalence relations on class of all groups
=> classify all groups up to isomorphism (instead of classifying all groups)
=> consider same if isomorphic
