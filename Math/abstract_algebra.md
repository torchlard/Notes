# injective
f: A -> B
f(x) = f(y) if and only if x=y

# surjective
∀ x∈B, ∃z such that f(z) = x

## group of units
every nonzero k has inverse in Z[0] if k is relatively prime to n
- set of all such non-zero elements as U(n) = group of units

unitary group of degree n U(n)
group of nxn unitary matrices, with group operation of matrix multiplication
- subgroup of general linear group GL(n,C)

Lie algebra of U(n) = n×n skew-Hermitian matrices, with Lie bracket given by commutator



## general linear group 
group if there exists inverse matrix A^-1 where (A^-1A) = (AA^-1) = I
det A ≠ 0

# history

Sopus Lie use group theory to study solution of patrial differential equations

# gorup
inverse, identity, associative

# symmetry
let triangle be
```

```
id

[A B C]

rotate to right
[A B C] // A->B, B->C, C->A
[B C A] 


# subgroup
let G be a group
a ∈ G, <a> = {a^k: k ∈ Z} is subgroup of G

## proper subgroup
proper subgroup of G
= subgroup H which H ⊂ G, H ≠ G

## normal subgroup
subgroup N of group G called normal subgroup of G
- invariant under conjugation by members of group that is a part
N ⊲ G <=> ∀n ∈ N, ∀g ∈ G : gng⁻¹ ∈ N
N ⊲ G <=> ∀g,h ∈ G, gh,hg ∈ N 


### properties
H ⊲ G, K ⊲ G containing H => H ⊲ K
normality is not transitive relation
G,H ⊲ G×H

N1 ⊲ G1, N2 ⊲ G2 => N1×N2 ⊲ G1×G2


## cyclic subgroup
`<a> = {na: n ∈ Z}`
for a ∈ G, <a> = cyclic subgroup generated by a

## cyclic group
G = cyclic group
order of a=n  such that a^n = e (repeat itself when index = n)

cyclic group can have >1 generator

eg. both 1,5 generate Z[6]
in Z[6], <2> = {0, 2, 4}, because 2^3 mod 6 = 2

every cyclic group is abelian

Z[n] = { integers r st. 1 ≤ r < n, gcd(r,n)=1 }

### complex number
Q*,R* has no interesting subgroups of finite order, C* has many
eg. T = {z ∈ C : |z| = 1} 
- circle group: unit circle in complex plane

circle group is subgroup of C*
subgroup of circle group: H = {1,-1,i,-i}
z^n = 1 => nth roots of unity


# permutation group
## def
permutation of set X form group Sx
if X is finite set, assume X = {1,2,..,n}, write Sn 
symmetric group on n letters: Sn

1. Sn is group with n! elements, binary operation = composition of maps

permutation group = subgroup of Sn

## cycle notation
[1 2 3 4 5 6] = (243)(56)
[1 4 2 3 6 5]

cycle of length 3 and length 2

a = (1352), b = (256)
=> 
1->3, 3->5, 5->2, 2->1
2->5, 5->6, 6->1
=>
1->3, 2->5->2
3->3->5 ...
ab = (1356)

two cycles in Sx a=(a1,a2...), b=(b1,b2,...) are disjoint if ai ≠ bj ∀i,j
eg. (135) and (27) are disjoint; (135) and (347) are not disjoint

(135)(27) = (135)(27)
(135)(347) = (13475)

identity permutation = (1)

## theorem
every permutation in Sn can be written as product of disjoint cycles

## transposition
product of cycles of length 2

(16)(253) = (16)(23)(25) = (16)(45)(23)(45)(25)

if identity written as product of r transpositions, id = r1r2...rn, where n is even

## alternating groups
set of all even permutations An, alternating group on n letters

num of even permutation in Sn (n ≥ 2) = num of odd permutations => order of An = n!/2

## Dihedral group
another special type of permutation group
nth dihedral group = group of rigid motions of regular n-gon (Dn)

number vertices of regular n-gon by 1,2...n
Dn is subgroup of Sn, of order 2n

operation: rotation, reflection

group Dn, n ≥ 3, consist of all products of two elements r and s, satisfying
r^n = id
s^2 = id
srs = r^-1

(label n reflections s1,s2,..sn; sk = reflection that leaves vertex k fixed;
r = rotation)

eg. in case of rotation
r = (1234)
r^2 = (13)(24)
r^3 = (1432)
r^4 = id

in case of reflection:
s1 = (24)
s2 = (13)

remaining 2 elements:
rs1 = (12)(34)
r^3s1 = (14)(23)

### cube example
order of group of cube: 
- to keep a side facing upward, there's 4 possible rotations
- ordr = 6×4 = 24

=> group of rigid motion of cube contains 24 elements


# cosets
let H be subgroup of G
left coset of H :
gH = {gh : h ∈ H} with g ∈ G

right cosets: 
Hg = {hg : h ∈ H}

## example
let H = {0,3} be subgroup of Z[6]
cosets are :
0+H = 3+H = {0,3}
1+H = 4+H = {1,4}
2+H = 5+H = {2,5}

in commutative group, left and right cosets always identical











# iosmorphism
group (G,∙) and (H,∘) are isomorphic if bijective ϕ: G -> H
and  ϕ(a∙b) = ϕ(a)∘ϕ(b)

##
let ϕ: H -> G be isomorphism of 2 groups
1. ϕ^-1: H->G also isomorphism
2. |G| = |H|
3. if G is abelian, then H is abelian
4. if G is cyclic, then H is cyclic
5. if G subgroup of order n, then H subgroup of order n

##
- all cyclic groups of infinite orders are isomorphic to Z
- if G is cyclic group of order n, then G is isomorphic to Z[n]

## goal
The isomorphism of groups determines an equivalence relations on class of all groups
=> classify all groups up to isomorphism (instead of classifying all groups)
=> consider same if isomorphic
