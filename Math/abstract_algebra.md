## group of units

- set of all such non-zero elements as U(n) = group of units

unitary group of degree n U(n)
group of nxn unitary matrices, with group operation of matrix multiplication
- subgroup of general linear group GL(n,C)

## general linear group 
group if there exists inverse matrix A^-1 where (A^-1A) = (AA^-1) = I
det A ≠ 0

# history

Sopus Lie use group theory to study solution of patrial differential equations

# gorup
inverse, identity, associative

# symmetry
let triangle be
```
 A
B C  
```
id
[A B C] 
[A B C]

rotate to right
[A B C] // A->B, B->C, C->A
[B C A] 


# subgroup
let G be a group
a ∈ G, <a> = {a^k: k ∈ Z} is subgroup of G

## proper subgroup
proper subgroup of G
= subgroup H which H ⊂ G, H ≠ G


### properties
H ⊲ G, K ⊲ G containing H => H ⊲ K
normality is not transitive relation
G,H ⊲ G×H

N1 ⊲ G1, N2 ⊲ G2 => N1×N2 ⊲ G1×G2

## unit modulo
eg. Z[8]

addition modulo = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
for multiplication modulo, cannot have all eleme 0-7, since inverse not exist for all
- only {1,3,5,7} meet requirement of group

satisfy 
1. 1 ≤ m < 8
2. gcd(m,8) = 1

U(8) = unit modulo 8 = multiplication modulo 8

## cyclic subgroup
`<a> = {na: n ∈ Z}`
for a ∈ G, <a> = cyclic subgroup generated by a

## cyclic group
G = cyclic group
order of a=n  such that a^n = e (repeat itself when index = n)

cyclic group can have >1 generator

eg. both 1,5 generate Z[6]
in Z[6], <2> = {0, 2, 4}, because 2^3 mod 6 = 2

every cyclic group is abelian

Z[n] = { integers r st. 1 ≤ r < n, gcd(r,n)=1 }

### complex number
Q*,R* has no interesting subgroups of finite order, C* has many
eg. T = {z ∈ C : |z| = 1} 
- circle group: unit circle in complex plane

circle group is subgroup of C*
subgroup of circle group: H = {1,-1,i,-i}
z^n = 1 => nth roots of unity


# permutation group
## def
permutation of set X form group Sx
if X is finite set, assume X = {1,2,..,n}, write Sn 
symmetric group on n letters: Sn

1. Sn is group with n! elements, binary operation = composition of maps

permutation group = subgroup of Sn

## cycle notation
[1 2 3 4 5 6] = (243)(56)
[1 4 2 3 6 5]

cycle of length 3 and length 2

a = (1352), b = (256)
=> 
1->3, 3->5, 5->2, 2->1
2->5, 5->6, 6->1
=>
1->3, 2->5->2
3->3->5 ...
ab = (1356)

two cycles in Sx a=(a1,a2...), b=(b1,b2,...) are disjoint if ai ≠ bj ∀i,j
eg. (135) and (27) are disjoint; (135) and (347) are not disjoint

(135)(27) = (135)(27)
(135)(347) = (13475)

identity permutation = (1)

## theorem
every permutation in Sn can be written as product of disjoint cycles

## transposition
product of cycles of length 2

(16)(253) = (16)(23)(25) = (16)(45)(23)(45)(25)

if identity written as product of r transpositions, id = r1r2...rn, where n is even

## alternating groups
set of all even permutations An, alternating group on n letters

num of even permutation in Sn (n ≥ 2) = num of odd permutations => order of An = n!/2

## Dihedral group
another special type of permutation group
nth dihedral group = group of rigid motions of regular n-gon (Dn)

number vertices of regular n-gon by 1,2...n
Dn is subgroup of Sn, of order 2n

operation: rotation, reflection

group Dn, n ≥ 3, consist of all products of two elements r and s, satisfying
rⁿ = id
s² = id
srs = r⁻¹

(label n reflections s1,s2,..sn; sk = reflection that leaves vertex k fixed;
r = rotation)

eg. in case of rotation
r = (1234)
r² = (13)(24)
r³ = (1432)
r⁴ = id

in case of reflection:
s1 = (24)
s2 = (13)

remaining 2 elements:
rs1 = (12)(34)
r^3s1 = (14)(23)

### cube example
order of group of cube: 
- to keep a side facing upward, there's 4 possible rotations
- ordr = 6×4 = 24

=> group of rigid motion of cube contains 24 elements


# cosets
let H be subgroup of G
left coset of H :
gH = {gh : h ∈ H} with g ∈ G

right cosets: 
Hg = {hg : h ∈ H}

## example
let H = {0,3} be subgroup of Z[6]
cosets are :
0+H = 3+H = {0,3}
1+H = 4+H = {1,4}
2+H = 5+H = {2,5}

[G : H] = 3
in commutative group, left and right cosets always identical

## theorem
let H be subgroup of G, g1,g2 ∈ G
1. (g1)H = (g2)H
2. H(g1⁻¹) = H(g2⁻¹)
3. (g1)H ⊆ (g2)H
4. g2 ∈ (g1)H
5. (g1⁻¹)g2 ∈ H

cosets of subgroup H partition larger group G

define index of H in G = num of left cosets of H in G
[G : H]
num of left cosets = num of right cosets of H in G

## Lagrange's theorem
prop1: let H be subgroup of G, g ∈ G, 
define ϕ: H -> gH by ϕ(h) = gh
map ϕ is bijective => |H| = |gH|

theorem: 
let G be finite group, subgroup H, 
|G|/|H| = [G : H] is num of distinct left cosets of H in G
=> |H| must divide |G|
- group G partitiond into [G : H] distinct left cosets, each left cosets has |H| elements
- |G| = [G : H]|H|

corollary1 : 
let H,K be subgroup of finite group G st. G ⊃ H ⊃ K 
=> [G : K] = [G : H][H : K]

theorem2:
two cycles τ,μ in Sn have same length <=> ∃σ ∈ Sn st. μ = στσ⁻¹

## Euler's theorem
let U(n) be group of units in Z[n], 
then |U(n)| = ϕ(n)


Euler ϕ-function
ϕ : N -> N defind by ϕ(n)=1 for n=1
for n>1, ϕ(n) = num of positive integers m 
with 1 ≤ m < n, gcd(m,n)=1
eg. |U(12)| = ϕ(12) = 4 = |{1,5,7,11}| relative prime to 12

let a,n be int st. n > 0, gcd(a,n)=1
then a^ϕ(n) ≡ 1 (mod n)

special case of n=p => Fermat's little theorem

## Fermat's little theorem
let p be any prime number, suppose pXa
then a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p)

example: calc 4^532 (mod 11)
by theorem, 4 relative prime to 11, 
so 4^(11-1) ≡ 1 (mod 11)

4^532 
= 4^(53x10+2) 
= (4^10)^53 x 4^2 
≡ 1^53 x 16 (mod 11)
= 1x5 (mod 11) = 5 (mod 11)


# iosmorphism
group (G,∙) and (H,∘) are isomorphic if 
bijective ϕ: G->H and ϕ(a∙b) = ϕ(a)∘ϕ(b)

let ϕ: G->H be isomorphism of 2 groups
1. ϕ⁻¹: H->G also isomorphism
2. |G| = |H|
3. if G is abelian, then H is abelian
4. if G is cyclic, then H is cyclic
5. if G subgroup of order n, then H subgroup of order n

## properties
- all cyclic groups of infinite orders are isomorphic to Z
- if G is cyclic group of order n, then G is isomorphic to Z[n]

## goal
The isomorphism of groups determines an equivalence relations on class of all groups
=> classify all groups up to isomorphism (instead of classifying all groups)
=> consider same if isomorphic

## Cayley's theorem (representation theorem)
if G is group, it's isomorphic to group of permutations on some set
=> every gorup is permutation group

aim: find an isomorphism of some group G that already know many


## kernel, image
Ker ϕ = {x ∈ G | ϕ(x)=e'} 
Im ϕ = {ϕ(x) | x ∈ G}


## Direct product
Cartesian product G × H

a group sometimes isomorphic to direct product of 2 smaller groups
- eaiser to study component groups

### external direct product
groups: (G,∙), (H,∘)
(g1,h1)(g2,h2) = (g1∙g2, h1∘h2)

Π[n.i=1]Gᵢ = G1 × G2 × ... × Gn
G = G1 = G2 = ... = Gn

eg. Z[n,2] is set of all binary n-tuples
(00111010) + (10011010) = (...)

#### theorem 1
(g,h) ∈ G×H, if g,h have finite orders r,s, then order of (g,h) = least common multiple of r,s

eg. (8,56) ∈ Z[12] × Z[60]
gcd(8,12) = 4
order of 8 = 12/4 = 3
order of 56 = 60/4 = 15
least common multiple of 3,15 = 15
=> (8,56) has order 15 in Z[12]×Z[60]

#### theorem 2
group Z[m]×Z[n] is isomorphic to Z[mn] <=> gcd(m,n)=1

eg. Z[2]×Z[3] ≅ Z[6]
Z[2]×Z[3]:
(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2)

show that Z[2]×Z[3] is cyclic
(1,1) is generator for Z[2]×Z[3]

#### theorem 3
Π[k,i=1]Z[nᵢ] ≅ Z[n₁n₂...nₖ]
<=> gcd(ni,nj) = 1 for i≠j

### internal direct product
aim: break down a big group
G be group with subgroup H,K:

G = HK = {hk: h ∈ H, k ∈ K}
H ∩ K = {e}
hk = kh ∀k ∈ K, h ∈ H

eg. U(8) = internal direct product of
H = {1,3}, K = {1,5}

#### theorem 1
let G be internal direct product of subgroup H,K
then G is isomorphic to H×K



# Normal subgroup and factor group
## normal subgroup
subgroup N of group G called normal subgroup of G
- invariant under conjugation by members of group that is a part
N ⊲ G <=> ∀n ∈ N, ∀g ∈ G : gng⁻¹ ∈ N
N ⊲ G <=> ∀g,h ∈ G, gh,hg ∈ N 
N ⊲ G <=> gN = Ng ∀g ∈ G

let G be ground, N ≤ G
1. subgroup N is normal in G
2. ∀g ∈ G, gNg⁻¹⊂N
3. ∀g ∈ G, gNg⁻¹=N

## factor group
if N is normal subgroup of group G,
then cosets of N in G from group G/N under operation (aN)(bN) = abN
- group called factor/quotient group of G,N
