# equivalence relation
binary relation that is
1. reflexive: a=a
2. symmetric: a=b and b=a
3. transitive: a=b and b=c then a=c

provides partition of underlying set into disjoint equivalence class

relations that are not equivalence:
≥, common factor>1

## quotient set
set of all possible equivalence class of X by ~
X/~ = {[x] | x ∈ X}
quotient set of X by ~

## projection
π : X -> X/~  defined by π(x)=[x]
let f: X -> B st. a~b -> f(a)=f(b)
∃ unique function g: X/~ -> B st. f=gπ

if f is surjection and a~b <=> f(a)=f(b),
then g is bijection

## partition
X is finite set with n elements, 
every equivalence relation over X correspond to partition of X
- #possible equivalence relation on X = #distinct partitioins of X
- Bell number Bₙ

## fundamental theorem of equivalence relations
- equivalence relation ~ on set X partitions X
- corresponding to any partition of X, ∃ equivalence relation ~ on X

each cell of parition ≡ equivalence class of X by ~
∀x ∈ X belongs to unique equiv class
natural bijection : {all possible equiv relation} <-> {partitions of X}

### partition ~ equivalence relation
if ~ and ≈ are 2 equivalence relation on S, a~b => a≈b
then ≈ coarser relation than ~, ~ is finer than ≈

finest: equality equivalence relation 
coarsest: make all pairs of elements relation 

equivalence relation = equivalence kernel of its surjective projection π:X->X/~
any surjection between sets determines partition on its domain
=> equivalence relation on X = partition of X = projection whose domain is X

## algebraic structure
much of mathematics grounded in study of equivalence and order relation

Lattice theory: mathematical structure of order relations

## group theory
equivalence relations grounded in:
- ordered sets: order relations
- partitioned sets: sets closed under pairwise supremum and infimum
  - which closed under bijection that preserve partition structure

all bijection map an equivalence class onto itself => bijection: permutation


# family of set
collection of set
example:
power set P(S), k-subsets S(k), class Ord of all ordinal numbers


# ordinal number
generalization of concept of natural number
- way to arrange collection of objects in order, one after another
- any finite collection of objects can put in process of counting

describe order type of well-ordered set


# index set
set whose members label numbers of another set
surjective function J->A 
indexed collection called indexed family {Aⱼ}ⱼ ∈ J

enumeration of set S gives an index set J ⊂ N, 
where f: J -> S is particular enumeration of S

coutably infinite set can be index by natural number
