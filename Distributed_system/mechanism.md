# consensus mechanism
achieve consensus without leader

## POW (proof of work)
run problem solving competition to get power to denote
adv:
- easy to implement, no need to exchange many info
disadv:
- high resource consumption, low efficiency

## POS (proof of stake)
depend on how much portion of node one is holding
adv:
- lower time needed
- less power consumption
divadv:
- still need mining

## DPOS (delegated proof of stake)
vote a few agent to verify and record
EOS super node

adv:
- much less node take part into verification, achieve second-level concensus
- more decentralized
- higher efficiency

disadv:
- rely on coin

## POOL (verification pool)
based on conventional distributed consistency algorithm
eg. pasox, raft

adv
- work without coin
disadv:
- more centralized

## PBFT (practical byzantine fault tolerance)
state machine replication in different nodes


# how to choose?
choose mechanism based on application context, 
whether in trusted / not trusted environment?
