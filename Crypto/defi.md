# AMM (Automated Market Maker)
all AMM data are on chain
unlike traditional CEX (centralized exchange)

your money always inside your wallet

## 無償損失
normally need you put ETH and USDT equivalent coins in pool
when someone buy ETH, assign to user, pool get USDT

if ETH price drop significantly, people convert ETH -> USDT
  you get more ETH, less USDT
if ETH price rise, system sell your ETH, convert back to USDT

if you are trading with alt coin (no value) => all your asset return to 0
