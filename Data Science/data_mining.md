traditionally use inductive learning, learn baesd on labelled data, and induce rules to apply on unlabelled data
since most of data are unlabelled, there are 3 ways to use unlabelled data in learning process

## semi-supervised learning
don't know what to predict in process of learning

## transductive learning
transductive learning: unlabelled data as testing data
inductive learning: unlabelled data is not testing data

## active learning
assume learner has certain ability to control environment, can ask something outside learner to query to get label on testing sample
