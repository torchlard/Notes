# local version control system
copy files into another directory (eg. timestamped directory)

# Centralized VCS
single server contains all versioned files

## adv
everyone knows what everyone else doing
easier to administer 

## disadv
1. single point of failure
2. if hard disk in central db corrupted => lose everything

# Distributed VCS
DVCS (git, Mercurial, Bazzar, Darcs)
client don't just check out latest snapshot of files, rather fully mirror repository
including full history

if any server dies, any of client repo can be copied backup to server to restore it
