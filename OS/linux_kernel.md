# intro
## monolithic kernel 
no access protection between various kernel subsystem
logical separation between subsystem, especially core and device driver

### modular design
component enable/disable at compile time
loadable kernel modules at runtime
strict interface low overhead: macro, inline function, function pointer

## micro kernel
large parts of kernel protected from each other, usually running as service in user space
code running in kernal very small -> micro kernel
- bugs in one service not impact other service (if no dependency)
- lower performance, simple function call need go through IPC and scheduling

## address space
common: RAM -> low address, graphics card memory -> high address
virtual address space: protected mode / paging enabled / virtual memory module activated

process space: virtual address space associated with process (continuous)
kernel space: memory view of kernel code, create mapping prevent direct access

## execution context
special execution context run in interrupt mode
-> always in kernel mode

# System Call
system call are not function call, but instruction that
1. setup info to identify system call and param, issue trap instruction
2. mode: user -> kernel
3. user stack, return addr, register saved on kernel stack
4. system call dispatcher: verify system call num, run kernel fn associated with system call
5. user space register restored, get result of system call
6. user space application resume

system call identified by numbers, param: machine word -> max 6 params
system lib offer functions implement actual system calls

## parameter handling
- never allow pointers to kernel-space
- check for invalid pointer

possible errors:
- pass pointer to read system call -> corrupt kernel memory
- unmaped, read-only pointer needed to be written -> kernel crash

2 approach checking invalid pointer
1. check against user address space before use
2. avoid checking, rely on MMU to detect, use page fault handler

- exact instruction that access user space recorded in exception table
- page fault occur -> faulting address checked against table

### Virtual Dynamic Shared Object
kernel provide virtual .so file, not in disk
when program init, kernel map .so to memory space
prepare different .so for different version kernel

optimize system call implementation
> time consuming each time software interrupt
> suitable for frequent but consume very few time calls

eg. x86 use "0x80", "sysenter" to issue system call
- stream of instruction issue system call, generated by kernel in special memory area
- memory area mapped to end of user address space
- libs search for VDSO, use if available

multiple virtual page --> same physical frame

### history
in early 32 bit instruction set, no instruction for system call
-> user mode use software interrupt to call
later "sysenter" appears in Intel, but not compatible

solution: let kernel decide system call method
introduce vsyscall in kernel address space, allow user mode read+execute



# process
## systemd (pid=1)
system's first process, only 1 not fork
- after kernel space initialization, act as daemon process to monitor all other processes
  
## kthreadd (pid=2)
created by systemd, manage and schedule all kernel threads
- maintain linked list of kernel threads
- always run in kernel space

# Init
last step of initiating kernel: start pid=1 init process
- parent of all processes, run as daemon process

compatible to SystemV => sysvinit
different init implementation

## sysvinit
predefined run levels

### adv
simple concept
service developer only need to write init and stop scripts
add/delete service to certain runlevel, only need run some create/del file link op
- no extra learning / special syntax needed

easy to debug, follow init sequence strictly, no concurrency

### disadv
low efficiency, slow init
problem in dynamic device loading

## upstart

## systemd



# pid
after program runs auto generate pid files under /var/run
pid only 1 line: record process ID

## purpose
avoid process create multiple copies
- only process who get write access (F_WRLCK) can normally start & write pid to file
- other process auto exit

## reminder
if process closed fd, then lock failed


# OOM killer
when system out of memory, kill process using most memory
