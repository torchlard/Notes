# payoff debt
## traditional
refactoring
increase unit test
delete dead code
reduce dependency
tightening API
improve documentation

## large system level complexity
ML package treated as black box => large mass of glue code

machine learning package is tool for mixing data sources together
- models are machines for creating entanglement

desired behavior cannot be effectively implemented in software logic without dependency on external data

1. isolate model, serve ensembles
2. gain deep insights into behaviors of model predictions
3. use more sophisticated regularization methods to 
   enforce any changes in prediction carry cost in objective function
