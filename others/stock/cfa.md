# math
## time value of money
lump sum: single cash flow
annuity: finite num of equal cash flow occur at fixed intervals
  - eg. monthly payment of $100 for 3 years

present value: value today of cash flow received/paid in the future
future value: value in the future of cash flow received/paid today

perpetuity: series of equal cash flow

effective interest rate: (v1-v0)/v0
= (1 + i/m)^m - 1

geometric mean return: compund annual growth rate 
= (FV/PV)^(1/n) - 1

$416.99 is present value of five $100 payments/receipts
- if you put $416.99 in a account paying 10% interest
- can withdraw $100 per year for five years

## statistics
mean absolute deviation = sum(x - mean)/n
standard deviation = sqrt(sum[(x-mean)^2] / N)

# economics
price control: max/min prices for goods, established by government
  - if price control set far from equilibrium
  - have significant negative economic consequences

artificial pricing give rise to black market
elasticity: sensitivity of supply and demand to changes in prices
   - inelastic demand means buyers not sensitive to price change
   - more willing to pay more tax burden

## macroeconomics
variable: inflation, unemployment, monetary policy
asffect entire economy or major portion of it

beyond control of individual / individual companies

### GDP (gross domestic product)
total market value of all domestically produced final goods and services 
  - purchased by their final users
  - intermediate production not included

good produced at a factory in US and sold in US would be included
- regardless of whether factory owned by US company
