## 回分
if downline's member wins, then downline no need bear cost
if member lost, downline can get benefit, but must reduce prev time member winnning part

eg. 50%
1st month: 
member win 1000, orginally agent cost 500, now no cost, save to next season

2nd month: 
member lose 2500, orig should get 1250, but cut agent last 500, remaining give to agent 750

## 賠率

not include 本金：principal=100, odds=0.95 => get 100.95

limit bet upper limit and lower limit, eg. 100 ~ 10,000

## 流水（洗碼）

eg. Baccarat: 100 on player, 100 on banker at same time => effective bet = 0

player wants 寶物交易 by bets

## 首儲
first time deposit discount
首儲 3000 give 50% => 1500, 流水 15 times

(3000 + 1500) x 15 = 67,500
寶物交易 threshold = 67500 + 3000 = 70,500
