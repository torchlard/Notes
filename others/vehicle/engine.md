# diesel VS petrol
diesel always use direct spray 
diesel has much higher compression ratio
- apply diesel at last minute 
- => give higher torque

petrol has more horse power
petrol has more rpm

horse power = torque x rpm

petrol engine: 20-38%
diesel engine: 40-45% thermal efficiency 

## air fuel ratio
diesel  14.5:1
petrol  14.7:1
- idle = 14-16.5
- cruise = 14-16.5
- wide open = 10.3-13.3


petrol: homogeneous mix of fuel and air
diesel: heterogeneous, on top
  - 15% more energy in same volume

## emission
diesel: harmful NOx and soot
petrol: CO2
