# awareness
1. keep scanning road ahead
2. use mirror, look around for final check
3. if view blocked by parked cars, move forward slowly
4. let others see you

## road sign
circle: give orders
triangles: warning
rectangle: information

## anticipation
anticipate what other road users might do
always be ready to stop

## distraction
using mobile phone while driving is illegal
don't slow down to see what incident happen on road side


# attitude
help other road user

dip light when
- following another vehicle
- meeting another vehicle coming towards you

good condition: 2s gap
wet condition: 4s gap
icy condition: 20s gap

if road user following too closely, 
- gradually increase gap between you and vehicle in front

## give priority
give priority to emergency vehicle
- emergency service use blue flashing light
- doctor's vehicle (green flashing light)

## crossing
zebra
pelican: give way to pedestrian
  - for flashing amber light, if clear, you may continue
puffin: sensor ensure red light shows until pedestrian crossed
toucan: allow cyclist cross same time
pegasus: rider, same as ordinary traffic light

toucan crossing | equestrian crossing (horse)
school crossing patrol



tailgating: follow another vehicle too closely

when heavy vehicle trying to overtake, slow down

diamond-shaped sign: tram

## turning
in one-way street, want to turn right => in right-hand lane

to avoid dazzing should apply footbrake

driving slow moving vehicle in narrow winding road
- pull in safely when you can


# safety
read line at roadside: no stopping at any time

## check items
light
exhaust system
tyre condition: uneven wear
- caused by faults in breaking system

tyre pressure: check once a week
  - undeer inflated tyres can
    - make steering feel heavy
    - increse fuel consumption
    - increase stopping distance

seat belt
speedometer 
horn
steering
speedometer
wiper
washers
brake 

windscreen: free of cracks and chips
oil and coolant level: important before long journey
brake fluid: if low, air may enter system, brakes won't work properly

## law requirement
keep in good condition
- seat belt
- headlight
- windscreen

## fuel usage
driving 70 mph more fuel than 50 mph by 30%

## tyre
tread on car and trailer tyres must be >= 1.6mm deep
across centre 3/4 of breadth

dry steering: turn steering wheel while car isn't moving
brake fade: brake less effective because of overheating

check tyre pressure when tyre are cold
- check once a week
- if pressure lower than recommended => rolling resistance

uneven tyre wear caused by
- braking system
- suspension
- wheel alignment

illegal to use tyres that have large deep cut in side wall
unbalanced wheel cause steering to vibrate  

## battery
top up battery with distilled water
- llevel just above cell plates

make sure each cell plate covered

## against thief
1. use steering lock
2. remove car keys and lock car, even only leaving for short time
3. take away valuables
4. don't leave vehicle registration documents in car
5. at night, park in well-lit area
6. anti-theft alarm / immobiliser
7. vehicle registration number etched on window => hard to sell vehicle

must not leave vehicle unattended with engine running

## parking
avoid 
- in front of property entrance
- near bus stop
- at a dropped kerb
- near brow of hill

parked on road at night, must use parking light when
- speed limit exceeds 30 mph

## ecosafge
1. reduce speed
2. plan well ahead, avoid rapid acceleration and heavy braking
3. miss out some gear when you're accelerating
4. tyre correctly inflated


## pollution
dispose old engine oil and battery responsibly
=> take to local authority site / garage (not to drain)

road transport account for 20% of all emission 

## suspension
if vehicle bounce when press down on front wing, shock absorber worn



# weather
## heavy rain
tyres lift off road surface and skate on film of water
-> steering becomes light

when drive through deep water, test brake
- ease off accelerator
- don't brake until steering feels normal again

## hot / bright
road surface may become soft -> melt
affect braking and steering

bright sunlight may dazzle 
- give arm signal if helpful

## freezing
make road very slippery
before journey clear ice and snow from window, light, mirror, number plates

- keep speed down
- brake gently and plenty of time
- clean windscreen 

## foggy
allow more time, slow down, increase gap
use dipped headlight / fog light for < 100m visibility

## windy
greater effect on high-sided vehicle

## ice
avoid skidding

contraflow system: >=1 lane have direction of traffic against rest of carriageway


# safety margin
go down steep hill: select low gear, use brakes carefully

affect by side wind: on open stretch of road

icy road avoid wheelspin: 
try to move off on snow:
  drive at slow speed in high gear

back of vehicle slide to right: stter carefully to right

down steep hill: low gear

park facing downhill:
  turn steering wheel towards kerb
  put handbrake on firmly

anti-lok brake: allow to steer and brake at the same time

after dealing with hazard always test your brake

apply break gently and lowly on icy roads

skid to right: ease off accelerator, steer carefully to right



# moving hazards
## pedestrian
patient and wait for pedestrian to finish corssing

## cyclist
at junctions / traffic light, give cyclist time to turn / pull away

## motorcyclist
look out when
- emerging from junction
- turn into road on right
- changing lane / move out to overtake

## driver of large vehicle
bus at bus stop
- people get off and then cross road
- bus about to move off


2-way road divided into 3 lanes 
=> traffic in both directions can use middle lane to overtkae

on rear of school bus or coach: show sign of students

pedestrian with white stick and red band => deaf and blind

flashing amber light under school warning sign:
  - reduce speed until you are clear of the area


# other types of vehicle
## motorcycles
keep well back

## large vehicles
if another vehicle fills gap you've left, drop back further

give large vehicle plenty of room in
- road junction
- crossroad
- mini-roundabout

## trams
extra care
- very quiet
- move quickly
- can't steer to avoid you

wait to emerge left, large vehicle approach from right
=> wait because large vehicle easily hide an overtaking vehicle

large vehicles may throw up a lot of spray when road is wet
=> drop back until you can see better

towing a caravan => extended-arm side mirror 

national motorway spped limit for vehicle: 60mph


# weather condition
## rain and wet
when there's rainfall, ford likely floor
when cross it
- use low gear
- drive through slowly
- test brakes afterwards, web brakes less effective

## fog
must use headlight and may use fog light

fog light
- dazzle other road user
- user behind can't see brake lights clearly
- user behind mistake fog lights for brake light, slow unnecessarily

## very bad weather
eg. heavy snow, thick fog
don't travel unless essential

make sure your lights are working, windows are clean

Areas reserved for trams
- white line marking
- different coloured surace
- different surface texture

to corrrect rear-wheel skid
- steer into it
- try to steer in same direction to recover control

coasting downhill is wrong
- vehicle will get faster
- less braking and steering control

travelling in neutral for long distance wrong
- no engine braking


# driving on motorway
join motorway
- use slip road adjust speed
- give way to traffic already on motorway

all traffic whatever speed should normally use left-hand lane
- middle and right lane for overtaking 
- normally turn right to overtake
- can overtake on left if traffic on right moving more slower

when uphill, separate lane for slow-moving vehicles

when travelling in left lane, traffic joining from slip road
- move to another lane if safe

overtake on left when
- queue of slow-moving traffic to right 
- that is moving more slowly than you are

## speed limit
national speed limit: 70 mph

vehicle towing trailer
- restrict to 60 mph
- not allowed to travel in right lane (>= 3 lanes)

## hard shoulder
swtich on hazard light, sidelight at night
leave vehicle 

use emergency roadside teephone
- allow easy location by emergency services

rejoin main carriageway of motorway
- move out onto carriageway, then build up speed

how to use emergency telephone on motorway
- face oncoming traffic

must not use motorways
- learner car driver
- farm tractor
- horse riders
- cyclists

## agency
Highways Agency Traffic Officers
- able to stop and direct anyone on a motorway

reduce traffic bunching: variable speed limi


# road type
## single carriageway
road with >= 1 lanes arranged within single carriageway 
with no central reservation to separate opposing flows of traffic

two-lane road: 1 lane for each direction

## dual carriageway
highway for traffic travelling in opposite directions separated by central reservation

## dual carriageway VS motorway
motorway
- only allow motorisd vehicle, no pedestrian / cyclist
- don't permit tractor and some other slow moving vehicle
- has hard shoulder 
- have 'M' designation before / after road number, eg. M1, A1(M)
  - A1(M): former dual carriageway (A1) upgraded to motorway
- junction always numbered
- blue sign: motorway, green: dual carriageway
- right hand lane only for overtaking
- exiting motorway almost always involve slip road
- roundabouts and traffic lights extremely rare

dual carriageway
- right hand lane can be for turning right
- roundabouts and traffic lights very common 


# speed limit

| type                            | built-up | single carriage | dual carriage | motorway |
|---------------------------------|----------|-----------------|---------------|----------|
| cars                            | 30       | 60              | 70            | 70       |

| goods vehicle (<= 7.5 tonnes)   | 30       | 50              | 60            | 70       |
| goods vehicles (> 7.5 tonnes)   | 30       | 40              | 50            | 60       |

## crossroad
turning right at crossroad when oncoming driver also turn right
- keep other vehicle to right, turn behind it

can wait when oncoming traffic prevent you from turning right

## roundabouts
signal left just after pass exit before the one you want

when approach roundabout: move nearer to centre line and signal direction

## reverse
neve reverse from side road into main road

no speed limit signs on road, 30mph indicated by street lighting

cross 30: end of minimum speed 30mph

# one-way street
may park on right-hand side
may overtake either on right / left

when intend to turn right, oncoming driver also turn right
- keep other vehicle to your RIGHT and turn behind it

## must not park
- near brow of a hill
- at or near a bus stop
- within 10m of a junction

park at night on road with 40mph limit
- should park with parking lights on

if travel in wrong direction in main road
- don't turn round / reerse from a side road into main road
- should turn into side road on right and reverse into main road

never reverse from a side road into a main road

in a road car coming towards you
- pull into a passing place on your left

when a vehicle is overtaking you
- dip light as soon as vehicle passes you

signals given by direction indicator and brake lights

safest way to turn vehicle around to go opposite way
- find quiet side road to turn round in

must have blue badge to park in a disabled space

amber flashing beacon for salting vehicle

min speed of 30mph: circle blue background white text

contraflow bus and cycle lane: one-way street

signal to turn right in busy traffic: give an arm signal

-> : two way traffic crosses a one-way road
<-

hump bridge
direction to park-and-ride car park

white arrow on road ahead: keep left of the hatched markings

## hazard warning
when there's queuing traffic ahead 
- you have to slow down / stop
- show hazard warning lights, alert following traffic to hazard
- switch them off as queue forms behind you




# vehicle loading
## keep your car stable
make sure vehicle isn't overloaded
- affect steering and braking

carry / tow heavy load
- increase air pressure in tyres
- adjust aim of headlights

- distribute weight evenly
- make sure load is fastened
- ensure loads don't obstruct your view when driving

load on roof rack
- increase wind resistance
- make vehicle less stable

animals
- should be restrained to ensure not interfere with driver / block driver's view
- travel in special cage

## towing
use stabiliser fitted to your towbar
if caravan / trailer has braking system, can fit breakaway cable as extra safety device
- pull on brakes of braked trailer

if trailer / caravan starts to swerve
- ease off accelerator
- reduce speed gradually to regain control

cannot use right lane in 3 lanes motorway
passengers not allowed to ride in caravan

breakaway cable can fit to trailer braking system
- if towbar fails the cable activate trailer brakes

use extended-arm side mirror

## inflate tyre
inflate tyre more than normal
- driving fast for a long distance
- carry a heavy load
