# awareness
1. keep scanning road ahead
2. use mirror, look around for final check
3. if view blocked by parked cars, move forward slowly
4. let others see you

## road sign
circle: give orders
triangles: warning
rectangle: information

## anticipation
anticipate what other road users might do
always be ready to stop

## distraction
using mobile phone while driving is illegal
don't slow down to see what incident happen on road side


# attitude
help other road user

dip light when
- following another vehicle
- meeting another vehicle coming towards you

good condition: 2s gap
wet condition: 4s gap
icy condition: 20s gap

if road user following too closely, 
- gradually increase gap between you and vehicle in front

## give priority
give priority to emergency vehicle
- emergency service use blue flashing light
- doctor's vehicle (green flashing light)

## crossing
zebra
pelican: give way to pedestrian
  - for flashing amber light, if clear, you may continue
puffin: sensor ensure red light shows until pedestrian crossed
toucan: allow cyclist cross same time
pegasus: rider, same as ordinary traffic light

toucan crossing | equestrian crossing (horse)
school crossing patrol



tailgating: follow another vehicle too closely

when heavy vehicle trying to overtake, slow down

diamond-shaped sign: tram

## turning
in one-way street, want to turn right => in right-hand lane

to avoid dazzing should apply footbrake

driving slow moving vehicle in narrow winding road
- pull in safely when you can


# safety
read line at roadside: no stopping at any time

## check items
light
exhaust system
tyre condition: uneven wear
- caused by faults in breaking system

tyre pressure: check once a week
  - undeer inflated tyres can
    - make steering feel heavy
    - increse fuel consumption
    - increase stopping distance

seat belt
speedometer 
horn
steering
speedometer
wiper
washers
brake 

windscreen: free of cracks and chips
oil and coolant level: important before long journey
brake fluid: if low, air may enter system, brakes won't work properly

## law requirement
keep in good condition
- seat belt
- headlight
- windscreen

## fuel usage
driving 70 mph more fuel than 50 mph by 30%

## tyre
tread on car and trailer tyres must be >= 1.6mm deep
across centre 3/4 of breadth

dry steering: turn steering wheel while car isn't moving
brake fade: brake less effective because of overheating

check tyre pressure when tyre are cold
- check once a week
- if pressure lower than recommended => rolling resistance

uneven tyre wear caused by
- braking system
- suspension
- wheel alignment

illegal to use tyres that have large deep cut in side wall
unbalanced wheel cause steering to vibrate  

## battery
top up battery with distilled water
- llevel just above cell plates

make sure each cell plate covered

## against thief
1. use steering lock
2. remove car keys and lock car, even only leaving for short time
3. take away valuables
4. don't leave vehicle registration documents in car
5. at night, park in well-lit area
6. anti-theft alarm / immobiliser
7. vehicle registration number etched on window => hard to sell vehicle

must not leave vehicle unattended with engine running

## parking
avoid 
- in front of property entrance
- near bus stop
- at a dropped kerb
- near brow of hill

parked on road at night, must use parking light when
- speed limit exceeds 30 mph

## ecosafge
1. reduce speed
2. plan well ahead, avoid rapid acceleration and heavy braking
3. miss out some gear when you're accelerating
4. tyre correctly inflated


## pollution
dispose old engine oil and battery responsibly
=> take to local authority site / garage (not to drain)

road transport account for 20% of all emission 

## suspension
if vehicle bounce when press down on front wing, shock absorber worn



# weather
## heavy rain
tyres lift off road surface and skate on film of water
-> steering becomes light

when drive through deep water, test brake
- ease off accelerator
- don't brake until steering feels normal again

## hot / bright
road surface may become soft -> melt
affect braking and steering

bright sunlight may dazzle 
- give arm signal if helpful

## freezing
make road very slippery
before journey clear ice and snow from window, light, mirror, number plates

- keep speed down
- brake gently and plenty of time
- clean windscreen 

## foggy
allow more time, slow down, increase gap
use dipped headlight / fog light for < 100m visibility

## windy
greater effect on high-sided vehicle

## ice
avoid skidding

contraflow system: >=1 lane have direction of traffic against rest of carriageway


# safety margin
go down steep hill: select low gear, use brakes carefully

affect by side wind: on open stretch of road

icy road avoid wheelspin: 
try to move off on snow:
  drive at slow speed in high gear

back of vehicle slide to right: stter carefully to right

down steep hill: low gear

park facing downhill:
  turn steering wheel towards kerb
  put handbrake on firmly

anti-lok brake: allow to steer and brake at the same time

after dealing with hazard always test your brake

apply break gently and lowly on icy roads

skid to right: ease off accelerator, steer carefully to right



# moving hazards
## pedestrian
patient and wait for pedestrian to finish corssing

## cyclist
at junctions / traffic light, give cyclist time to turn / pull away

## motorcyclist
look out when
- emerging from junction
- turn into road on right
- changing lane / move out to overtake

## driver of large vehicle
bus at bus stop
- people get off and then cross road
- bus about to move off


2-way road divided into 3 lanes 
=> traffic in both directions can use middle lane to overtkae

on rear of school bus or coach: show sign of students

pedestrian with white stick and red band => deaf and blind

flashing amber light under school warning sign:
  - reduce speed until you are clear of the area


# other types of vehicle
## motorcycles
keep well back

## large vehicles
if another vehicle fills gap you've left, drop back further

give large vehicle plenty of room in
- road junction
- crossroad
- mini-roundabout

## trams
extra care
- very quiet
- move quickly
- can't steer to avoid you

wait to emerge left, large vehicle approach from right
=> wait because large vehicle easily hide an overtaking vehicle

large vehicles may throw up a lot of spray when road is wet
=> drop back until you can see better

towing a caravan => extended-arm side mirror 

national motorway spped limit for vehicle: 60mph


# weather condition
## rain and wet
when there's rainfall, ford likely floor
when cross it
- use low gear
- drive through slowly
- test brakes afterwards, web brakes less effective

## fog
must use headlight and may use fog light

fog light
- dazzle other road user
- user behind can't see brake lights clearly
- user behind mistake fog lights for brake light, slow unnecessarily

## very bad weather
eg. heavy snow, thick fog
don't travel unless essential

make sure your lights are working, windows are clean

Areas reserved for trams
- white line marking
- different coloured surace
- different surface texture

to corrrect rear-wheel skid
- steer into it
- try to steer in same direction to recover control
