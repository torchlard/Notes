# CHP (combined heat and power)
highly efficient process capture and utilise heat 
- by product of electricity generation process

30% less commission compare to boiler and power station

# Micro-cogeneration
micro combined heat and power
generate heat and electricity simultaneously

# window
## double glazing
use 2 sheet of glass with gap between as barrier
more expensive
twice effective at stopping heat escaping home

## secondary glazing
installing supplementary glazing on inside of existing single glazed window
far cheaper, DIY
better level of acoustic insulation


# intro
can be 2 main systems cover different systems heating different parts of dwelling

if system 1 heats all habitable rooms, no system 2 unless serves DHW only
second main system =/= secondary heater

secondary heater: room heaters heating individual rooms


## main heating
heat large portion of dwelling
not usually based on individual room heaters
provides hot water and space heating
cheapest to run

## secondary heating
always based on room heaters

## fuel source
LPG
bioethanol
B30K oil

Anthracite nuts / grains
house coal
smokeless fuel, eg. coalite
  - used in smoke control areas
wood, pellets, logs, coppice

smoke control area
  - open fire: smokeless
  - closed heater: anthracite

not smoke control area
  - open fire: dual fuel
  - closed heater: wood logs / anthracite

# boiler type info
fuel
date of manufacture
flue type
non-condensing / condensing
regular / combi
automatic ignition / permanent pilot light
floor, wall, back boiler

## electric underfloor / ceiling heating
used in extensions and living rooms

# heat pump
some require supplementary on-peak direct electric heating

# control
## room thermostat
sensing device measure air temperature within building
switch on and off space heating
can set single target temperature
- stop boiler and heating pump when desired temp reached

## programmable room thermostat
can set different target temperature for space heating 
usually in daily / weekly cycle

## thermostatic radiator valves (TRV)
radiator valve with air temp sensor
control heat output from radiator by adjusting water flow

## programmers and zone control
digital programmer: clock to control 'on' periods for space heating and hot water
time switch: hot water (+ space heating)
zone control: 
- separate control of different zones
- separate room thermostats
- if >= 2 thermostats present => zone control

## storage heat controls
differ from standard control types
- manual
- automatic

- CELECT-type control
  - central programmer used to individually control each unit



## weather or load compensation
internal (load) or external (weather) air temperature

## hot water only
single-point gas water heater
multi-point gas water heater
range cooker 
from community system
