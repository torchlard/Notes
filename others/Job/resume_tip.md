Be Specific with Business Value
Vague bullet points and experiences, especially those that don’t discuss business value, seriously detract from an otherwise solid resume.

Hiring managers are busy. They aren’t going to take the time to sift through a ton of dime-a-dozen statements (like “Used Python and SQL on a daily basis…”), so it’s best to focus on statements that quantify your contributions.

Consider discussing how you reduced costs, increased revenue, or saved company time by increasing efficiency, in conjunction with the specific skills and tools you used to solve complex problems.
