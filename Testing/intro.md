# assertion
1. assertions are not for error handling
2. no side effects
3. no silly assertions



# principle
interfaces that span trust boundaries are special
must be tested on full range of representable values


# fault injection
faults that we want our code to be robust to

# system testing
testing as a whole
often black box testing

just require perform acceptably

## differential testing
same input, different implementation


# regression testing
reuse input that make system fail previously

# test coverage
+ give us an objective score
- not very helpful in finding errors of omission
- difficult to interpret score < 100%
