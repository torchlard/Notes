# direction
## left
left lane, left indicator
left means exit 1, doesn't matter where it is

## ahead
left lane, no indicator
exit number > 1, between 6-12 o'clock inclusive

## right
right lane, right indicator
exit number > 1, position after 12 o'clock


# roundabout sign
short fat sign: entrance onto roundabout, should be ignored

pointed bits = associated to text
still count deadend as an exit

# lane
the outside will always go to the next exit
other lane may also go there but there's no guarantee
