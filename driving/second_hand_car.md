buy from a dealer and use a credit card to pay some of it so you can invoke section 75 if shit goes south

make sure the car is properly taken care of and MOT is alright, if they cannot provide it, go away

Use an OBD sensor to check for basic code, you can get one from Amazon, again go away if it pops out weird code

Buy a proper car check to make sure its history is clean

Buy a reliable car brand and check for common faults from car forums/Facebook before you go
