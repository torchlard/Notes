# clock synchronization
## global average
each node broadcast local clock time (T0 + iR)
after waiting period, estimate skew of own clock wrt. all other nodes
discard highest m and lowest n

## localized averaging
nodes in specific patterns ring/grid
node exchange clock time with neighbors, setclock time to avg
