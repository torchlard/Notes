# extensionality / extensional equality
objects are equal if they have same external properties

f(n) = (5 + n)*2
g(n) = n*2 + 10

these two extensionally equal, but definitions not equal
- perform same mapping
function identity as intensional property
- based on implementation

lambda calculus = implementation of mathematical function


# intensionality
property / quality connoted by word
